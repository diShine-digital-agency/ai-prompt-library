# prompt-library Powerhouse

**82+ expert-level prompt templates — with a CLI, a browser-based Prompt Workshop, and desktop apps — to search, browse, compose, create, lint, optimize, and test prompts with AI models.**

If you work with LLMs regularly, you've probably got prompts scattered across Notion docs, Slack messages, and random text files. This library brings them together: organized, searchable, and ready to use.

**Three ways to use it:**

| Interface | How to open |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CLI** | Clone the repo → `node bin/prompt-lib.js list` (or install globally with `npm install -g @dishine/prompt-library`) |
| **Browser app** | Open `viewer.html` in any browser — no server, no internet required |
| **Desktop app** | Build from source with `./desktop/build-all.sh` — native window on macOS, Linux, and Windows |

All three give you the same features: search and browse prompts, compose multi-layer prompts, create custom prompts with dynamic fields, generate prompts from frameworks, lint prompts for quality, optimize them automatically, and get smart recommendations. The browser and desktop app also include an **AI Playground** to send prompts directly to GPT, Claude, or Gemini.

Zero npm dependencies. Just Node.js built-in modules.

## ⚡ Prompt Workshop (viewer.html)

The **Prompt Workshop** is a standalone HTML file — no server, no build step, no internet required. Just open `viewer.html` in any browser and you get the full prompt library with an interactive interface.

### What it does

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Browse** | Search and filter all 82+ prompts by category, difficulty, model, or keyword. Click any prompt to read the full content, copy it, or build it interactively. |
| **Compose** | Build layered prompts by combining a **system prompt** (persona) + **reasoning framework** (technique) + **task template** (the work). All three combine into one powerful prompt. |
| **Create** | Build your own custom prompts with dynamic `{{field_name}}` placeholders. Define fields, write the body, and save to your personal library. |
| **Generate** | Pick a proven framework, answer guided questions, and get a production-ready system prompt generated automatically — no prompt engineering experience needed. |
| **Tools** | **Prompt Linter** (14-rule quality analysis with 0–100 scoring), **Prompt Optimizer** (content-aware rewriting — detects your domain, replaces vague language, strengthens weak verbs, removes filler, adds domain-specific role/constraints/output format/quality checks + optional AI-powered rewriting), and **Smart Recommender** (describe your use case, get personalized prompt suggestions with a recommended system prompt + framework + template combo). See [FUNCTIONS.md](FUNCTIONS.md) for full details. |
| **Playground** | Send prompts directly to AI models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini). Add a system prompt, see responses, track token usage — iterate without leaving the tool. |
| **My Library** | All your saved prompts, filled templates, and compositions. Stored in your browser's localStorage — persists across sessions. |

### Quick Fill & Compose

Many prompts include `{{field_name}}` placeholders. When you open one, you'll see a **⚡ Quick Fill** button that gives you a streamlined experience:

1. **Only the fields appear** — no distraction, just the inputs you need to fill
2. **Field descriptions** tell you exactly what each placeholder expects
3. **Live preview** updates as you type — see the assembled prompt in real time
4. **Progress bar** tracks how many fields you've completed
5. **One-click copy** — paste the filled prompt directly into your AI tool

This is the fastest way to use templates from the library. No prompt engineering knowledge required.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`7` | Switch between tabs (Browse, Compose, Create, Generate, Tools, Playground, My Library) |
| `Ctrl+K` | Focus the search box |
| `H` | Toggle beginner help tips on/off |
| `D` | Toggle dark mode |
| `Esc` | Clear search |

### Beginner mode

Click the **?** button (top-right) to toggle beginner help tips. When enabled, each tab shows contextual guidance explaining what the feature does, how to use it, and pro tips for better results. Perfect for people new to prompt engineering.

### API Settings (⚙)

Click the **⚙** button (top-right) to configure API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Keys are stored locally in your browser — never sent anywhere except the API provider. Required for the Playground and AI-powered optimization.

## Prompt format

Every prompt file uses YAML frontmatter with Markdown content:

```markdown
---
title: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
category: frameworks
tags: [reasoning, step-by-step, problem-solving]
difficulty: intermediate
models: [claude, gpt-4, gemini, llama, mistral]
---

# Chain-of-Thought Prompting

[Content with sections: When to Use, The Technique, Template, Examples, Tips, Common Mistakes]
```

### Metadata fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | human-readable name |
| `category` | one of the categories listed above |
| `tags` | searchable keywords |
| `difficulty` | `beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced` |
| `models` | which LLMs this technique works best with |

---

## Programmatic usage

```javascript
import { loadPrompts, findPlaceholders, extractTemplate } from '@dishine/prompt-library';
import { searchPrompts } from '@dishine/prompt-library/src/search.js';
import { generatePrompt, getFrameworks } from '@dishine/prompt-library/src/generator.js';

const prompts = loadPrompts();
const results = searchPrompts(prompts, 'code review');

console.log(results[0].title);   // "Code Review Prompt"
console.log(results[0].content); // full prompt content

// Generate a prompt from a framework
const prompt = generatePrompt('expert-role', {
  role: 'data analyst',
  domain: 'business intelligence',
  task: 'Build SQL queries from natural language',
});
```

---

## Adding your own prompts

The library is designed to be extended. To add a prompt:

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate `prompts/` subdirectory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `title`, `category`, `tags`, `difficulty`, `models`
3. Structure the content with these sections:
   - **When to use** -- when this technique applies
   - **The technique** -- detailed explanation
   - **Template** -- copy-paste ready template with `{{placeholders}}`
   - **Examples** -- real-world usage examples
   - **Tips** -- expert advice from actual use
   - **Common mistakes** -- pitfalls to avoid

The CLI picks up new files automatically -- no registration step.

Or use `prompt-lib create` to build prompts interactively and save them to your personal library.

## Desktop & Mobile Apps

The Prompt Workshop runs as a **native application** on all desktop platforms — each with its own window, app icon, and one-click installer. No terminal needed after building.

Desktop apps are built from source (no pre-built downloads). You need Node.js 18+ and Bash:

```bash
# Clone and build for all platforms
git clone https://github.com/diShine-digital-agency/ai-prompt-library.git
cd ai-prompt-library
./desktop/build-all.sh
```

| Platform | How to install |
|----------|----------------|
| **macOS** (built on Mac) | Build → move `dist/PromptWorkshop.app` to Applications. Native Swift app, runs in its own window. Requires Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). |
| **macOS** (built on Linux) | Build → move `dist/PromptWorkshop.app` to Applications. Opens in browser (no native window). |
| **Linux** | Build → extract `dist/prompt-workshop-linux.tar.gz` → double-click `install.sh`. Native GTK window on most desktops (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint), falls back to browser. |
| **Windows** | Build → extract `dist/PromptWorkshop-win.zip` → double-click `Install.bat`. Opens in Edge app mode (own window), falls back to Chrome or browser. |
| **Android / iOS** | Open `viewer.html` in browser → "Add to Home Screen" |

All three desktop apps run in their **own window** (no browser chrome) with custom app icons, keyboard shortcuts, and persistent storage. See [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting.
