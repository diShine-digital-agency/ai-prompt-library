# prompt-library Powerhouse

**82+ expert-level prompt templates — with a CLI, a browser-based Prompt Workshop, and a desktop app — to search, browse, compose, create, lint, optimize, and test prompts with AI models.**

If you work with LLMs regularly, you've probably got prompts scattered across Notion docs, Slack messages, and random text files. This library brings them together: organized, searchable, and ready to use.

**Three ways to use it:**

| Interface | How to open |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CLI** | `npm install -g @dishine/prompt-library` then `prompt-lib list` |
| **Browser app** | Open `viewer.html` in any browser — no server, no internet required |
| **Desktop app** | Build with `./desktop/build-all.sh` for macOS, Linux, or Windows |

All three give you the same features: search and browse prompts, compose multi-layer prompts, create custom prompts with dynamic fields, generate prompts from frameworks, lint prompts for quality, optimize them automatically, and get smart recommendations. The browser and desktop app also include an **AI Playground** to send prompts directly to GPT, Claude, or Gemini.

Zero npm dependencies. Just Node.js built-in modules.

## ⚡ Prompt Workshop (viewer.html)

The **Prompt Workshop** is a standalone HTML file — no server, no build step, no internet required. Just open `viewer.html` in any browser and you get the full prompt library with an interactive interface.

### What it does

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Browse** | Search and filter all 82+ prompts by category, difficulty, model, or keyword. Click any prompt to read the full content, copy it, or build it interactively. |
| **Compose** | Build layered prompts by combining a **system prompt** (persona) + **reasoning framework** (technique) + **task template** (the work). All three combine into one powerful prompt. |
| **Create** | Build your own custom prompts with dynamic `{{field_name}}` placeholders. Define fields, write the body, and save to your personal library. |
| **Generate** | Pick a proven framework, answer guided questions, and get a production-ready system prompt generated automatically — no prompt engineering experience needed. |
| **Tools** | **Prompt Linter** (14-rule quality analysis with 0–100 scoring), **Prompt Optimizer** (content-aware rewriting that detects your domain, replaces vague language, strengthens weak verbs, adds domain-specific constraints + optional AI-powered rewriting), and **Smart Recommender** (describe your use case, get personalized prompt suggestions). |
| **Playground** | Send prompts directly to AI models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini). Add a system prompt, see responses, track token usage — iterate without leaving the tool. |
| **My Library** | All your saved prompts, filled templates, and compositions. Stored in your browser's localStorage — persists across sessions. |

### Quick Fill & Compose

Many prompts include `{{field_name}}` placeholders. When you open one, you'll see a **⚡ Quick Fill** button that gives you a streamlined experience:

1. **Only the fields appear** — no distraction, just the inputs you need to fill
2. **Field descriptions** tell you exactly what each placeholder expects
3. **Live preview** updates as you type — see the assembled prompt in real time
4. **Progress bar** tracks how many fields you've completed
5. **One-click copy** — paste the filled prompt directly into your AI tool

This is the fastest way to use templates from the library. No prompt engineering knowledge required.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`7` | Switch between tabs (Browse, Compose, Create, Generate, Tools, Playground, My Library) |
| `Ctrl+K` | Focus the search box |
| `H` | Toggle beginner help tips on/off |
| `D` | Toggle dark mode |
| `Esc` | Clear search |

### Beginner mode

Click the **?** button (top-right) to toggle beginner help tips. When enabled, each tab shows contextual guidance explaining what the feature does, how to use it, and pro tips for better results. Perfect for people new to prompt engineering.

### API Settings (⚙)

Click the **⚙** button (top-right) to configure API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Keys are stored locally in your browser — never sent anywhere except the API provider. Required for the Playground and AI-powered optimization.

## Prompt format

Every prompt file uses YAML frontmatter with Markdown content:

```markdown
---
title: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
category: frameworks
tags: [reasoning, step-by-step, problem-solving]
difficulty: intermediate
models: [claude, gpt-4, gemini, llama, mistral]
---

# Chain-of-Thought Prompting

[Content with sections: When to Use, The Technique, Template, Examples, Tips, Common Mistakes]
```

### Metadata fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | human-readable name |
| `category` | one of the categories listed above |
| `tags` | searchable keywords |
| `difficulty` | `beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced` |
| `models` | which LLMs this technique works best with |

---

## Programmatic usage

```javascript
import { loadPrompts, findPlaceholders, extractTemplate } from '@dishine/prompt-library';
import { searchPrompts } from '@dishine/prompt-library/src/search.js';
import { generatePrompt, getFrameworks } from '@dishine/prompt-library/src/generator.js';

const prompts = loadPrompts();
const results = searchPrompts(prompts, 'code review');

console.log(results[0].title);   // "Code Review Prompt"
console.log(results[0].content); // full prompt content

// Generate a prompt from a framework
const prompt = generatePrompt('expert-role', {
  role: 'data analyst',
  domain: 'business intelligence',
  task: 'Build SQL queries from natural language',
});
```

---

## Adding your own prompts

The library is designed to be extended. To add a prompt:

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate `prompts/` subdirectory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `title`, `category`, `tags`, `difficulty`, `models`
3. Structure the content with these sections:
   - **When to use** -- when this technique applies
   - **The technique** -- detailed explanation
   - **Template** -- copy-paste ready template with `{{placeholders}}`
   - **Examples** -- real-world usage examples
   - **Tips** -- expert advice from actual use
   - **Common mistakes** -- pitfalls to avoid

The CLI picks up new files automatically -- no registration step.

Or use `prompt-lib create` to build prompts interactively and save them to your personal library.

## Desktop & Mobile Apps

The Prompt Workshop runs as a **native macOS application** with its own window — no browser needed. On Linux and Windows it opens in your default browser as a lightweight self-contained package.

```bash
# Build for all platforms at once
./desktop/build-all.sh

# Build just macOS native app (requires Mac + Xcode Command Line Tools)
./desktop/build-macos.sh
```

| Platform | Archive | Type | Install |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **macOS** | `PromptWorkshop.tar.gz` | Native app (own window) | Extract → drag to `/Applications/` |
| **Linux** | `prompt-workshop-linux.tar.gz` | Browser wrapper | Extract → `./install.sh` → launch from app menu |
| **Windows** | `PromptWorkshop-win.zip` | Browser wrapper | Extract → double-click `PromptWorkshop.vbs` |
| **Android / iOS** | — | — | Open `viewer.html` in browser → "Add to Home Screen" |

The macOS native app features its own window, menu bar, Dock icon, Spotlight support, keyboard shortcuts (⌘C/V, ⌘+/-, ⌃⌘F full screen), and persistent storage independent of your browser.

See [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md) for detailed install instructions (including step-by-step for non-technical users), troubleshooting, and platform-specific notes.
